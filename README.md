# A highly simplified example of *dada2* workflow

## Instructions

You are going to **fork** this repo to your personal github account (**not** the *fundamentals-eDNA* account).  Here's how:

- click the fork <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/GitHub_Fork_Button.png" height="10"> button (top right corner)
- when prompted, select your personal account
- that's it!

Now you can **clone** (i.e. copy to your local computer) that repo from your personal account.  You can refer back to these instructions: https://fundamentals-edna.github.io/rstudio_github.  **BUT** you don't need to start at the beginning of those instructions, start at the paragraph that begins "Next hit the green 'Code' button..."

Make sure the git HTTPS URL that you are copying reads something like this:

```
https://github.com/[[your_account]]/dada2_example.git
```

(where `[[your_account]]` is indeed your account name).  You want to make sure it does not read like this:

```
https://github.com/fundamentals-eDNA/dada2_example.git
```

That means you're cloning the version in our shared repo rather than the version in your personal repo.  We want to leave the version in the shared repo as an unchanged template.  Conversely, the version that you fork into your own repo is yours to manipulate and because it lives under your personal account, changes you make to it will only be reflected there, not in the *fundamentals-eDNA* organization account.
